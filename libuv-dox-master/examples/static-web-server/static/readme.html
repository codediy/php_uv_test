      <p>This simple example shows how to build a simple static web server with libuv.</p>
      <p>It is by no means stable, complete or correct. It&#39;s sole purpose is to illustrate how to use the different methods
      exposed by libuv to archieve this.</p>
      <p>Fixing most of these problems are out of the scope for a simple example like this (just think MIME types).</p>
      <h2 id="serving-a-request">serving a request</h2>
      <p>After starting the server much in the way <a href="https://github.com/thlorenz/libuv-dox/tree/master/examples/send-file#starting-server">explained
      here</a>, we handle each request as
      follows:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>parse request via <a href="https://github.com/thlorenz/libuv-dox/blob/master/examples/static-web-server/request-parser.c">our request parser</a> which is a small wrapper arount
      <a href="https://github.com/joyent/http-parser">http-parser</a></li>
      <li>after determining what resource we are supposed to serve we try to <a href="https://github.com/thlorenz/libuv-dox/blob/master/examples/static-web-server/resolve-resource.c">resolve the appropriate file including it&#39;s
      size</a></li>
      <li>finally we open the file and <a href="https://github.com/thlorenz/libuv-dox/blob/master/examples/static-web-server/pipe-file.c">pipe it into the
      response</a>, the details of
      which are explained inside the <a href="https://github.com/thlorenz/libuv-dox/tree/master/examples/send-file">send-file example</a></li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="known-problems-bugs">known problems/bugs</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>at this point no headers are sent, leaving the client to figure out what we are sending</li>
      <li>files are opened but never closed - this will be fixed soon</li>
      <li>probably lots more that I have overlooked</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you find bugs, please submit a pull request to fix this. However as this is an example additions to make this more
      complete are not desired as this is quite large enough for an example already.</p>
      <p>I am planning on spinning another repo out from this and make improvements there while keeping the example small.</p>
